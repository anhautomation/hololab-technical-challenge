# Hololab Technical Challenge

This repository presents my submission for the **Hololab Technical Challenge**, organized into two independent but complementary deliverables.

Each deliverable is intentionally scoped to highlight a different dimension of technical leadership:  
**architecture-level reasoning** and **practical system implementation**.

---

## Challenge 1 – System Design  
**Digital Human Platform Architecture**

This deliverable focuses on **high-level system design** for a Digital Human platform.

The design emphasizes:
- Clear separation between product logic and AI capabilities
- Long-term scalability and evolution paths
- Vendor-agnostic integration with LLM, Voice, and Avatar/Expression AI services
- Operational concerns such as cost control, monitoring, and global delivery

This challenge is presented as an **architecture artifact**, not an implementation guide.

## Challenge 2 – Programming Skills  
**Persona-based LLM Chatbot System**

This deliverable implements a **persona-driven LLM chatbot system** to demonstrate
how system boundaries and behavior constraints can be enforced at the application level.

The focus is on:
- Correct separation of responsibilities between frontend, backend, and LLM providers
- Persona and knowledge boundary enforcement
- Clean, extensible system structure rather than model-level optimization

This challenge is supported by a running system for interactive evaluation.
